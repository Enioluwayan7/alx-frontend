# 0x03. Responsive Design

## Overview

This project focuses on building responsive web designs that provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices. The primary goal is to create web pages that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations by using fluid grids, flexible images, and CSS media queries.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will have learned the following:
- Principles of responsive web design
- The difference between mobile-first, desktop-first, and responsive design
- How to create fluid grids and flexible images
- How to implement CSS media queries for various screen sizes
- Best practices for ensuring accessibility on responsive websites
- How to test responsiveness across different devices and browsers

## Project Requirements

- Use **HTML5** and **CSS3** to build the layout of the pages
- Implement **media queries** to make the design responsive for devices of all sizes (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Use **flexbox** or **grid** for layouts where appropriate
- Ensure that images are flexible and scalable using CSS
- Test the design in different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop) and orientations (portrait and landscape)
- Create a responsive navigation menu that works well on both mobile and desktop screens
- Use best practices in accessibility and performance

## Project Tasks

1. **Mobile-First Design**
    - Start with a basic mobile layout and gradually scale up the design for larger screens.
    - Implement a flexible grid system for content placement.

2. **Responsive Typography**
    - Ensure text is readable on all screen sizes by using relative units like `em`, `rem`, or percentage.

3. **Flexible Media**
    - Make images, videos, and other media content scale appropriately for different screen sizes.

4. **Media Queries**
    - Use CSS media queries to create breakpoints that adapt to various screen widths, including:
        - Small screens (phones): up to 600px
        - Medium screens (tablets): 600px - 1024px
        - Large screens (desktops): above 1024px

5. **Navigation Menu**
    - Create a responsive navigation menu that collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.

6. **Testing Responsiveness**
    - Use browser dev tools or online platforms like Chrome DevTools to simulate different device screen sizes and orientations.
    - Ensure that the layout looks consistent and maintains usability across all devices.
